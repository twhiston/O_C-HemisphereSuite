### TomW's further additions:

* No Darkest Timeline
* No Usb Midi or apps 
    This is the biggest change, midi will not work anywhere as all the libraries and apps have been removed. I needed the space in memory!!!
* More settings for internal clock (useful when using outputs for clocking something at a high PPQ)
* Metronome app saves state of internal clock settings (as it is assumed you are using it as a master clock in this mode)
* More Experimental Hemisphere apps

### firmware:

Hemisphere Suite is an open-source project by Jason Justian (aka chysn)

ornament**s** & crime**s** is a collaborative project by Patrick Dowling (aka pld), mxmxmx and Tim Churches (aka bennelong.bicyclist) (though mostly by pld and bennelong.bicyclist). it **(considerably) extends** the original firmware for the o_C / ASR eurorack module, designed by mxmxmx.

### hardware:

eurorack / teensy 3.2 DAC8565 quad 16bit CV module w/ OLED display

14HP, depth ~ 25mm
